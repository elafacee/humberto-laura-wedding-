        <h2>Our Love Story</h2>
        <p>From the very first time our paths crossed at the UFC Gym in February 2023, we knew that God had a special plan for us. Our connection was instant, and it was clear that our shared faith would be the cornerstone of our relationship. Our first date at Cuba Café wasn't just about the delicious food, but about discovering our shared dreams and aspirations. As our relationship blossomed, we officially began our journey together on June 24, 2023. Our first kiss under the fireworks on July 4th was a...
        <p>Our adventures took us to San Francisco for our first trip together, where the beauty of God’s creation made our love even stronger. We faced challenges too; our first Christmas saw me in the hospital, but Humberto was my rock, caring for me and showing the true spirit of love and sacrifice. As we stepped into 2024, we celebrated his new business venture on January 9, a testament to his hard work and God's blessings. The proposal on March 15, back in San Francisco, was a dream come true, surro...
        <p>Our commitment to our faith deepened as we dedicated the twins at church on April 21. Each new experience, from Humberto's first time serving as an Armor Bearer to our joyful trips to Disneyland, brought us closer to each other and to God. Our civil union on June 24 was just the beginning, followed by a heartfelt baptism as a newlywed couple on June 30, symbolizing a new life together under God’s watchful eyes.</p>
    
<p>In August 2024, our journey took us to Michoacán, Mexico, to visit Humberto's parents' church where we were embraced not just as visitors but as messengers of faith. We were blessed with the opportunity to preach and teach, connecting with the congregation on a profound level. It was during this time that the Lord confirmed we would be a power couple, destined to uplift each other and those around us through faith, hope, and love.</p>
<p>Now, as we approach our wedding ceremony on November 16, 2024, we stand ready to embrace all that life has to offer, fortified by our love, our faith, and the blessings of our friends and family.</p>
